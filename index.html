      <h1>Carlos Vilhena</h1>
      <p class='doc'>
        I am a full stack software engineer with 8+ years of commercial engineering
        experience for startups across Europe.
      </p>
      <p class='doc'>
        Up until now, Ruby and Clojure have been my tools of
        choice, both because of their friendliness but also the amazing tooling
        around them, allowing me to solve the problems I need in a productive and
        happy way.
      </p>
      <p class='doc'>
        I love solving complex problems, taking projects from concept to release and
        working in small, fast paced teams. I find it thrilling to take an idea and
        bring it to life.
      </p>
