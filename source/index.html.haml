  %p.doc
    With a background in Software Engineering, I have commercial Engineering and
    Management experience for high growth startups, established businesses and
    public institutions across Europe for the past 12 years. I've worked remotely
    for over 3 years and that's the setup where I feel happier and more
    productive.

  %p.doc
    I love solving complex problems, grow engineering teams, taking projects#
    from concept to release and working with fast-paced teams to deliver value
    and scalable solutions.

  %p.doc
    I have professional experience in Ruby, Javascript, Python and Machine
    Learning, building a large variety of systems from APIs, websites and data
    pipelines.

  %p.doc
    Besides that, I have a strong interest in functional programming. I am
    currently exploring Elixir, having previously used Clojure and Haskell.
