  %p.doc
    I am a full stack software engineer with 10+ years of commercial engineering
    experience for startups across Europe.

  %p.doc
    I love solving complex problems, taking projects from concept to release and
    working in small, fast paced teams. I find it thrilling to take an idea and
    bring it to life.

  %p.doc
    I've recently been working with Ruby, Javascript, Python and Machine
    Learning, building a large variety of systems from APIs, Websites and data
    pipelines.
    Besides that, I have a strong interest in functional programming. I am
    currently exploring Elixir, having previously used Clojure and Haskell.
